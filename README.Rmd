README: Research Project on HIV-Related Stigma and Depression in Older Adults
Project Title: Association Between HIV-Related Stigma and Depression in Adults Aged 50 and Older: A Study in the Pacific Northwest (2003-2005)
Purpose of the Study
This project investigates the relationship between HIV-related stigma and depression among adults aged 50 and older in the Pacific Northwest. It aims to:
1.	Assess whether higher levels of stigma are associated with increased odds of depression.
2.	Examine how demographic factors such as age, sex, and race influence this relationship.
Data Source
The study utilizes secondary data from the University of Washington-Tacoma ICPSR dataset 33242, which includes information on stigma, depression, and demographic variables for individuals aged 50 and older from the Pacific Northwest between 2003 and 2005.
Dataset Information
•	Sample Size: 25 participants.
•	Key Variables: 
o	Dependent Variable: Depression (binary: Depressed vs. Not Depressed).
o	Independent Variable: HIV-related stigma (continuous).
o	Covariates: Age, sex, and race.
Methods
1.	Data Preparation:
o	Cleaned and recoded depression into binary categories for analysis.
o	Addressed missing data and ensured reproducibility by documenting all steps in R scripts.
2.	Statistical Analysis:
o	Conducted logistic regression to evaluate the association between stigma and depression.
o	Univariate and multivariate models were used to control for demographic covariates.
o	Assessed model fit, multicollinearity, and performance metrics.
Key Findings
1.	Univariate Analysis:
o	Higher stigma was significantly associated with increased odds of depression (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04–1.26, p = 0.0143).
2.	Multivariate Analysis:
o	The association remained positive (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02–1.36) but was not statistically significant (p = 0.105) after adjusting for age, sex, and race.
3.	Group Comparisons:
o	Depression was more common among males, Non-White participants, and those aged 50-54 years.
Outputs
1.	Table 1: Baseline characteristics stratified by depression status.
2.	Logistic Regression Results: Odds ratios and confidence intervals for univariate and multivariate models.
3.	Visualization: Scatter plots and bar charts highlighting key findings.
Reproducibility
1.	Software:
o	R version 4.2.0.
2.	Scripts:
o	All analysis scripts are saved in the scripts/ directory.
3.	File Structure:
o	scripts/: Contains R scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
o	docs/: Documentation files, including this README.
4.	Sharing:
o	Scripts and outputs are shared on [GitHub repository link].
Usage Notes
•	Ensure proper citation of the dataset and this research when using any outputs.
•	All steps and analyses are documented for full reproducibility.
